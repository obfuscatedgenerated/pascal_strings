## What are Pascal strings?

Pascal strings are a method of storing string data by prepending the length of the string at the start, rather than appending a null byte. This has some key advantages, such as optimisation *(think iteration)* and string handling safety *(e.g. missing null byte)*, as well as preventing the need to pass the string length or predict it using `strlen` when using certain functions.

They were first implemented in the UCSD implementation of the *Pascal* programming language, hence the name.

## Examples of use cases

They can be found in a variety of programs, but the most famously known implementation is in *Microsoft Excel* (accurate as of [2010](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/492384/how-to-find-the-size-of-an-array-from-a-pointer-pointing-to-the-first-element-a#comment3358256_492428)).
